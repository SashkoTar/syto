# Filter fundamentals

Simpy digital or analog filter can be drawn schematically like this. There is input sequence of values handled by linera time-invariant filter, which generates an output sequence.

Output sequence depends on filter's main characteristic which is called impulse response - h(n). Impulse response defines the reaction of LTI system in zero state on unit impulse. It is very important to know that having applied Laplace transformation to impulse response function we'll recieve transfer function of filter. If system is discrete than Z-transformation should be used instead of Laplace transformation. Below is depicted transfer function for digital filter after Z-transformation.  

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;H(z)=\frac{b_{0}+b_{1}z^{-1}+b_{m}z^{-m}}{a_{0}+a_{1}z^{-1}+a_{n}z^{-n}}"/>

It seen that a transfer function is also a rational function. As it turns out the process of filter design converges to finding two vectors - B = [b0...bn] and A = [a0...an] which contain coeficients of polynomials at numenator and denumenator respectivelly. There are several approximations

## Usage
Having done some calculation user comes to conclusion that he needs digital third order low-pass Butterworth filter with cutOff frequency 3.5 Hz sampled at rate 30 Hz. Therefore to get cooficients for transfer function polynomials user has to call such chain 

```scala 
   val (b, a) = new TransferFunctionBuilder()
      .butterworthApproximation(3)
      .digitalize(30)
      .transformToLowPass(3.5)
      .coefficients
```

Then user can start filtering itself using lfilter method

``` val y = lfilter(b, a, x) // x is sequence of input signals 
```
